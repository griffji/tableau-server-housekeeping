#Tableau Server on Linux Logs and Cleanup Script

# 	HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:
# 		Run the setup.bash script in this Github repo to fetch the script and install it in your system correctly 
#		https://github.com/til-jmac/tableau-server-housekeeping/blob/master/linux/setup.bash
#
#		Test that the script works in your environment by running it manually
#			You must execute the script as a user that is a member of the tsmadmin group
#			sudo su -l <tsmusername> -c /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/scripts/tableau-server-housekeeping.sh <tsmusername> <tsmpassword>
#
#		NOTE you have to add your tsm username and password at the end of the command to execute the script. 
#			This avoids you having to hardcode credentials into the script itself
#
#		*UPDATE* starting in 2019.2 the above requirement to include credentials will no longer be necessary,
# 			provided the user executing the script is a member of the tsmadmin group  
#
#		Schedule the script using cron to run on a regular basis
#			sudo su -l $tsmuser -c "crontab -e"
#		
#		For example, to schedule it to run once a day at 01:00, add this to your crontab
#			0 1 * * * /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/scripts/tableau-server-housekeeping-linux.sh > /home/<tsmuser>/tableau-server-housekeeping.log
